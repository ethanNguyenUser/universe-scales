dimension_description: Cost translates human effort, resources, and time into a single comparable number denominated in money. It compresses supply chains, regulation, and risk into prices that move daily with geography and policy. For each entry, I specify a concrete item or service and the condition of purchase, such as retail, wholesale, or per unit time. The aim is scale and perspective rather than price quotes, so values are representative snapshots with context.
