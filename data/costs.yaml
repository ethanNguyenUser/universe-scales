dimension_description: Cost translates human effort, resources, and time into a single comparable number denominated in money. It compresses supply chains, regulation, and risk into prices that move daily with geography and policy. For each entry, I specify a concrete item or service and the condition of purchase, such as retail, wholesale, or per unit time. The aim is scale and perspective rather than price quotes, so values are representative snapshots with context.

- description: A grain of rice costs less than a ten-thousandth of a dollar when purchased in a 25-pound bag for about $15. Large processors such as Riceland Foods and ADM mill and package thousands of tons daily using automated equipment. The main expense lies in energy and transportation, not the grain itself. It’s an example of how mechanization and global trade have pushed the price of basic calories close to zero.
