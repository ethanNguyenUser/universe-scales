base_unit: meters_per_second
dimension: speed
dimension_description: Speed tells how fast position changes with time, without caring about the direction of travel. It is the scalar magnitude behind commuting, sprinting, and orbiting, the number you see on a speedometer. Human bodies sense acceleration more than speed, but fatigue and safety often map back to speed limits. Each entry below identifies a specific context so the values can be tested against experience or instruments.

- description: Continents creep at centimeters per year as plates slide on the mantle, which is a few nanometers per second. Over a lifetime this sums to meters, enough to redraw coastlines for future generations. GPS networks now measure this motion directly. The value represents a typical mid ocean ridge spreading rate.
