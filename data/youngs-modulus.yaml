base_unit: pascals
dimension: youngs-modulus
dimension_description: Youngs modulus describes linear elastic stiffness, the ratio of stress to strain for small reversible deformations. It is the slope of the initial part of a stress strain curve under uniaxial load at stated temperature and rate. Microstructure, porosity, and moisture can shift it dramatically for natural materials. Each value below includes a representative condition so comparisons hold water.
items:
- description: Soft rubber stores little energy per strain because chains uncoil easily, leading to a very low modulus. As strain rises, entropic elasticity stiffens the response. Fillers like carbon black raise the modulus by reinforcing the network. The value given is for an unfilled gum rubber at room temperature.

  value: 1e6
- description: Polymer foams behave like springs in a scaffold of cells, so their effective modulus is tiny until densification. Cell size, gas content, and skin layers matter as much as chemistry. Designers tune this for pillows versus helmet liners. The value is for a flexible open cell foam in small strain compression.

  value: 1e5
- description: Softwoods are anisotropic; along the grain the modulus is moderate, across the grain it is an order lower. Moisture acts like a plasticizer that reduces stiffness. Builders season wood to stabilize this property. The value is longitudinal for dried spruce.

Healthy joints depend on this time dependence for shock absorption. The value is an initial small strain tangent.

- description: Cortical bone has a modulus in the tens of gigapascals along the osteon direction due to mineralized collagen. Age and disease reduce both stiffness and toughness. Implant designers choose alloys to match this to avoid stress shielding. The value is for human femoral cortical bone in tension.
