dimension: duration
dimension_description: Duration measures time intervals across everything from
    quantum events to cosmic evolution. Time gives us the framework for understanding
    cause and effect, change, and how things move toward disorder. This dimension
    covers both quick events and slow processes, showing us how time works from
    tiny particles to giant galaxies.
items:
- description: The smallest time interval that makes sense in physics, derived
    from fundamental constants. At this scale, gravity and quantum effects
    become equally important, breaking our normal understanding of space and time.
    Think of it as the shortest possible "moment", shorter than any computer
    can measure or any experiment can detect.

- description: How long it takes for nuclear forces to work inside atoms,
    specifically when protons and neutrons exchange particles. This is the
    timescale that keeps atomic nuclei stable despite electrical repulsion.
    It happens incredibly fast, faster than you can blink your eye
    by a factor of billions.

- description: How long an electron takes to orbit once around a hydrogen
    atom nucleus. This is like a tiny solar system where the electron
    travels at incredible speed. The electron completes about 6.6 million
    orbits every second, imagine a race car doing laps around a track
    that fast.

- description: How fast atoms vibrate when connected in molecules, like
    carbon atoms in organic compounds. These vibrations happen when atoms
    shake back and forth around their normal positions. The frequency
    is incredibly high, about a trillion times per second, creating
    the molecular "music" that defines chemical bonds.

- description: How long a nerve cell takes to fire completely, from start
    to finish. This includes the electrical spike that travels down
    the nerve fiber.     The whole process takes about 1 millisecond,
    roughly the time it takes for a camera flash to go off.
    After firing, the nerve needs time to recharge before it can fire again.

- description: How long one complete heartbeat takes in a healthy adult
    at rest. This includes both the squeeze when blood gets pumped out
    and the relaxation when the heart fills up again. The duration
    changes with activity, faster during exercise, slower when sleeping.
    Most people have 60-100 beats per minute when resting.

    or say "one Mississippi."

  value: 3600
- description: How long Earth takes to rotate once relative to the Sun,
    averaging 24 hours. This creates our daily rhythm of light and dark,
    which shapes everything from sleep cycles to work schedules.

  value: 86400
- description: A seven-day period that matches our natural work and
    rest rhythm. This duration fits well with lunar cycles and provides

  value: 604800
- description: The average length of a calendar month, about 30.44 days
    based on our 365.25-day year divided by 12 months. This accounts
    for the fact that months have different lengths, some 28 days,
    some 31. It's a practical middle ground between weeks and seasons,
    perfect for planning projects, billing cycles, and monthly routines.
  name: Month

- description: The cycle between major ice ages, averaging about
    100,000 years. This is driven by changes in Earth's orbit
    and tilt that affect how much sunlight reaches different
    parts of the planet. The cycle includes roughly 80,000 years
    of ice advance and 20,000 years of warming, we're currently

- description: About 66 million years since an asteroid impact
    wiped out the dinosaurs. This event also eliminated about
    75% of all species on Earth. The extinction cleared the
    way for mammals to diversify and eventually led to human
    evolution. It marked the end of the Age of Reptiles and
    the beginning of the Age of Mammals.
