base_unit: joules
dimension: energy
dimension_description: Energy measures the capacity to cause change, whether moving a mass, breaking a bond, or warming a room. In practice it ties together force, distance, and heat with a single bookkeeping number that must be conserved. For any process you care about, from a heartbeat to a supernova, energy is the currency that balances the before and after. Here we compare characteristic amounts for specific objects and conditions so the numbers map to lived experience.
