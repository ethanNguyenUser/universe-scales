base_unit: pascals
dimension: yield-strength
dimension_description: Yield strength marks the stress where a material stops returning to its original shape and begins to deform permanently. Engineers usually define it by a 0.2 percent offset on a tensile test curve at room temperature unless noted. The value depends strongly on processing, microstructure, and loading rate. Each entry states a representative condition so comparisons are meaningful.

- description: Soft elastomeric rubber shows a low apparent yield because long polymer chains uncoil and slide instead of breaking. Under slow uniaxial tension at room temperature it flows at stresses near this level. Fillers and crosslink density can raise the value substantially. The number is for a common natural rubber compound.

- description: Flexible polymer foams yield when cell walls buckle and collapse, absorbing energy as they densify. The stress plateau around this value is prized for cushioning. Strain rate and temperature swing the response in real products. The number is for an open cell polyurethane foam in compression.
