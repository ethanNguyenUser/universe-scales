base_unit: pascals
dimension: pressure
dimension_description: Pressure is force per unit area, the intensity with which a surface is pressed. It explains why a stiletto heel dents wood while a snowshoe floats, even with the same weight. In fluids, pressure transmits uniformly and drives flow from high to low according to gradients. Every value below names a setting and condition so the number connects to daily life or specific experiments.

- description: Between galaxies, particle densities are so low that mechanical pressure approaches zero for human purposes. Radiation fields and magnetic stresses still act, but as a pressure they are vanishingly small. Spacecraft enjoy this quiet except when hit by solar storms. The value is an order of magnitude benchmark for deep space plasma pressure.

The conversion factor links the two worlds cleanly.
