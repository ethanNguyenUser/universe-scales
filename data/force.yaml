dimension: force
dimension_description: Force quantifies how strongly an interaction changes motion or shape, linking directly to acceleration by Newton’s second law. In contact problems it is the agency behind pushes, pulls, and pressures; at a distance it expresses gravity and electromagnetism. Engineers budget forces to keep bridges stable and joints safe. Each entry below states the object and condition so the number is actionable, not abstract.

- description: Intermolecular attractions in liquids and soft solids often manifest at piconewton scales per interacting pair. This is the regime probed by optical tweezers and single molecule experiments. Such forces set surface tension and viscosity that we experience in droplets and gels. The value represents a typical cohesive tug between nearby molecules.
